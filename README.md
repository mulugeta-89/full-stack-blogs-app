# Full-Stack Blogs Website
Welcome to the Full-Stack Blogs Website project! This is a web application that allows users to upload their blogs, edit and delete them with a good user interface. This project was created to enhance my web development skills using SASS, React, Node.js, and MySQL database.

# Description
This full-stack blogs website is a personal project created to showcase my skills in web development. The application uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API for interacting with the MySQL database. React is used for the front-end, while SASS is used for styling the user interface. User authentication is implemented using JWT for security purposes.

The website has the following features:

User-friendly interface: The website has an intuitive interface that is easy to use.
User authentication: Users must log in to upload, edit, or delete their blogs. This is implemented using JWT for security purposes.
CRUD functionality: Users can create, read, update, and delete their blogs.
